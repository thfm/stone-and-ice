## Gameplay

### Aim

Go as far as you can without hitting any obstacles (the dark grey cubes).

### Controls

Use the arrow keys (or A and D) to move sideways.

### Mechanics

There are two types of floor surface: *stone* and *ice* (hence the name of the game). The difference between the two is the amount of friction that they have (with ice being much 
'smoother' than stone). You will also slowly rotate when on an ice surface.
